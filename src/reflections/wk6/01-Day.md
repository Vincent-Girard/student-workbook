# Monday - Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding component Based Architecture 

## What is Component based architecture? 

This is a method of encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface or "components" into self-sustaining, independent microsystems. These are used to break parts of your website up and will allow for easier troubleshooting. 

## What are some benefits of Component based Architecture? 

Components are able to have their own interfaces that can make calls ot the server and update the interfaces. Because they are compartmentalized they can refresh independently without affecting other components on your page. 

## What are some drawbacks to component based architecture? 

Using CBA you would unintentially bloat and pollute views. Compared to MVC, it seems like a lot of the code is going to mesh together, making it a little less intuitive to read. It seems like it is succeptible to over-thinking. Meaning that it wouldn't be hard to overdo it and completely screw up your application.
