# Thursday Front End Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes 

## What is a nested route? 

Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with the components we have previously talked about nested inside of each other. 

## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You could use this for like a website like best buy. 

instead of having different pages to China/America, you might have televisions and gaming. The possibilities are endless with this, basically you could build most of the websites like Target/Amazon/Walmart etc doing this. 

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When Might you use them?

Yes. In the example of the travel, you may wish to pass the parameter of the country you are trying to visit. You may want to use these to get information to different parts of the code.
