# Monday Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > How to use props in Vue
_Journal Entry_

## What are props?
Props are the vehicle in which we use to pass variables and other information to different components. We can pass them in multiple place for example the template and the script. 

Props in Vue are passed down the component tree to descendents (and not up)
Props are read-only and CANNOT be modified. 

## What are props used for?

They are used to pass information that is critical to other functions/methods/etc. This information that they pass allows the function to run properly and get back the intended result. 

## Where can props be used or access?

they can be used inside of the script tags. This can be used inside methods, computed props, or other js related things. 

They can be accessed from the template. You can use the state. notation to access this or sometimes you can use this. notation to get it.
