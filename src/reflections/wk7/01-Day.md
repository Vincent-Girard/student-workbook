# Monday 1/25 Vue3 > Pair Programming

## 1. What is pair programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair Programming is where two develoeprs share a workstation and code together, there are 2 roles for this. 

1. Driver - This is the person that is using the computer and actually writing the code
2. Navigator - this is the person that shows the driver where to go and helps them ensure the code is accurate 

It is expected that you switch roles every few minutes or so 

## What are some of the benefits of pair programming? 

You have two people's brainpower which will allow for less common mistakes to be made. Both people can draw from their experience which would encourage discourse to find the best solution. 

## What are some of the drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Both programmers must be actively engaged, otherwise it is sort of a waste of time. Another common issue is that the driver needs to actively say what they are doing out loud to ensure the navigator knows hwere they are going, if they do not it is a gigantic waste of time/navigator needs to intervene.
