# Thursday 1/28 Reflect on your partner project and and answer the following questions?


## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
We had one person be the navigator and the other person be the driver. We were communicating and making sure that we didn't have typos in the code and that what we wanted to do would work. 

## What went well?
The code most of the time worked on the first try. THis was because we were both drawing from our knowledge/experience and making sure that we were making the right decisions. 

## What would you do differently? 

We ended up communicating differently in the middle because we would both want to try a solution if the code didn't work. If one person wanted to tyr theirs first, we just had the other person wait and it ended up working really well.
