## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code documentation is writing down the way that your functions/methods/etc work. THis will ensure that when you return to the code after having spent time away/worked on other projects, yo uwill know how to use it. It also is sort of a map to the code you have written for other people to use in case they need to jump in in the case of a absence, etc. 

- How to guides
- - REAME
- code documentation in the source

## What are some of the benefits of Code Documentation?

It allows people with 0 knowledge of your code to jump in and be able to use it effectively/make adjustments. There will be less ambiguity with your code and as a result you will be able to revisit it easily without having to spend a bunch of time figuring it out. 

## HOw important is code documentation and why? 

It's really important because you are going to be writing code for a company and that company will probably wnat to know how it works whether you are employed there or not anymore. It's common for people to change jobs (within reason haha), so you don't want to completely hamstring them by writing code and not having one of these documents.
