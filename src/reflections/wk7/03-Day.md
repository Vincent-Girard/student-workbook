You will less likely miff your customers because you will have considered them as the primary reason for why you wrote yoru code the way you did. You will make it a much more satisfying experience for the end user and will make them want to use your app again. 

## Why is the User Experience important? 

If you don't consider the UX, they you are likely going to push a large portion of the client base away. This is because people have a lot of options in today's world that they can pick and choose who they do business with. If somethign is easier/available on Amazon and your UX is bad, they'll probably just feed bezos.
