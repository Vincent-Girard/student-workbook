Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions

##   1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

This might seem silly but I think that it is the one about not changing the fonts and changing the colors. I think that this is going to allow me to have less novice looking material and really propel me into people thinking I know what I am doing. 

 ##   2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

  ##  3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

  Good designs typically show that the business is more trustable, since the perception is that because their website is good they have "money to spare". Through design you could convey a lot, a perfect user experience would most certainly help convey the amazingness of your design.
