## In your own words, why do we use Git? 

We use git because it allows us to use Git as the control.  It allows us to track changes in the code and build test environments aka (Branches). Branches will allow us to work on specific features or only certain commits. In order to get the code from a developer's laptop to Git, it needs to be committed. Committing is accompanied with a message (-Fixed bug in JS), allowing us to see what each commit was working on instead of digging through lines of code. 

 ## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

 Multiple branches allow us to only work with all or certain parts of the code that has been committed. It will allow multiple teams to work on environments with the commits that are relevant to them and allows for parallel developments. Some of the commits that are in the master branch may conflict with the ones you are working on and you only want to resolve them when you are ready to merge to the Master Branch. 

 ## What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 

 Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of any changes made to your source code. Github is a cloud-based host that allows you to manage Git repositories.
