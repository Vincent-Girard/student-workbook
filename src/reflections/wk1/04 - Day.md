Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions

##    1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

The purpose of wiring framing is to give you the framework for a solidly designed UX. It overall will further your UX because it is going to be more fleshed out and hopefully have less nasty surprises in store for you. It allows you to keep what was important front of mind. It allows you to break the UX into lamens terms, for key decisions makers that are not familiar with the vernacular. It allows you to simplify your idea or website. 

##    2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low Fidelity Wireframes - These are the earliest of drafts of the webpage, it can be created very loosely, without scale/grid/pixel accuracy. It ommits detail that might distract others and simplifies the process

Mid Fidelity Wireframes - This is the versio nwhere the features are clearly different from eachother. They are much more accurate representations of the layout but still avoid using distracting images or typograhphy. This is useful because it can help you readjust if you need to before going super into detail on things, things are still malleable in this stage. 

High-Fidelity wireframes- These are the highest level of wireframe that wil be pixel-specific layouts. These will have the images and anything written that is relevant. This allows you to get a final check before you start the meat and potatoes. 





##   3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

They are 100%, without a doubt, worth the time and effort. Each level offers advantages but they allow you to flesh out the website. They are sort of like a coloring book and you just have to color the rest in (depending on the level). If you sort of mindlessly start coding it is going to be harder and harder the further you go to define the UX.
