## This course has been pretty great, it seems like the right way to learn it is the way that you teach it (hard way first, easy way second). It's been a pretty great experience with some areas for improvement, but overall, I am very glad I chose codeworks. I will manage my time by time boxing any problems I come across, being resourceful, and making sure I keep a steady pace over the week to meet the deadline of the Friday final turn in.
