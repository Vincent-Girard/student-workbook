# Monday Node/Express > Using Query Parameters
_Journal Entry_

## What is the purpose of a Query String?
It's used to gain access to the information you are trying to get. It is adding a part to the end of the URL which ultimately is the only reason you can gain access to the information. 
 

 ## What is the format of a query parameter? How Does it Start? How do you dinstinguish between one paarameter and the next?
?answer=42  - single querry 
?a=1&b=2 

The first example is an example of a query parameter that only has one request. The second is a parameter that has 2 and they are separated by the ampersand or "&".


 ## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server? 

They would be helpful when you are trying to organize your information. In the example of the color white, they added "color:" by putting it in bracket notifications to help them be able to categorize the parameter they just passed. If you don't organize your data correctly it would be easy to get lost in a sea of information.
