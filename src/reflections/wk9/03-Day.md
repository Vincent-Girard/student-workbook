# Wednesday February 10th, 2021 Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams


## 1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

They are able to develop much faster, typically smaller teams have the ability to learn/unlearn/and relearn in way that is not as common on large teams. They can provide a little better transparency which enables them to create the right atmosphere to drive change. 

## 2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

It would be a quality vs quantity argument, it would appear that if there were multiple sprints that you may spread the team too thin and focusing on too large of a scope. It's the same argument that fast isn't quality, the triangle. 

## 3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Good Service Cheap won't be Fast -

Good service Fast won't be Cheap - 

Fast service Cheap won't be Good - 

This is saying that there are trade offs to each approach, if you try to cut down costs, it may take longer. If you try to do something fast, it's not going to be high quality, and that good service fast is going to require a higher payout. It's keeping in mind that shortcuts and sacrifices may not work out the way that you intend.
