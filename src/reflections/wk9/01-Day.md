# Monday February 8th, 2021 Reflect on your capstone so far


## 1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using a lot of the stuff we learned about scrum in our projects and keeping on top of our schedule. We are using bootstrap, sweet alerts, and lots of other things that we learned in the classroom. 

## 2. What went well so far? 

We have been working really well together so far and there hasn't been any friction. We are able to comes to decisions as a group and as the "product owner" I am more or less just facilitating the conversation and encouraging everyone to share their opinion, rather than just having 1 or 2 people bulldoze it. 

## 3. What would you do differently? Why? 

I would do the back end a little bit differently, we would just need to plan out the back end a little bit better and figure out the relationships prior to starting. I would have planned out the relationships with a little bit more detail and just moved on instead of getting hung up on a couple of things.
