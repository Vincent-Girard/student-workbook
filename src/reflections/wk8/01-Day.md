## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It can give your prospective employers a taste of what you are able to accomplish at any given point during your career. It can make you stand out significantly and it can help you prove that you know your craft. 

## What makes a developer Portfolio effective?

It's concise, you aren't flooding your portfolio with a ton of different projects making it unknown which of your efforts will be reviewed. 

## What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio, why? 

None at the moment, but that being said. I knew that I was going to eventually come back to a few of these and make them more aesthetically pleasing and add some more functionality. I would probably do bugger and inspire, those are likely the ones so far that I would put into a portfolio.
