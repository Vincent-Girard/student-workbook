# Working in a prof environment testing in Vue


## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing-The prupose of unit testing is to provide devs with peace of mind/confidence in what they wrote. 

Component Testing- This is to be able to test the components that have to be mounted to the dom and ensure that they are in full working order 

End-To-End testing- This is sort of a full level fo application, as if you were a customer trying to use it

## What testing method do you think is the most useful, why? 

End to end - This will likely encompass most of the things that you would find in the other tests. This will provide that the necessary functionality is working within the software/application. 


## What testing method do you think is the lease useful, why? 

Unit Testing - I think that this is the least useful because it seems mostly just to ensure cofidence in the code that is written and is the least focused on the user experience. It's not that it isn't important, but in the grand scheme of things it seems to be the one that provides the least amount of value.
