# Tuesday 2/2/21 Working in a professional environment > Scrum for small teams 


## Why is communication on a small team important?
When you effectively communicate you reduce double efforts, everyone knows where you currently are and where you need to be etc. You can keep everyone in the loop at the same time and reduce the amount of dreaded meetings that you have to attend. 

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use agile methodology effectively in a small team? 

You would need to change the team size in order to fulfill the requirements to meet agile. You would also need to be a little bit quicker as agile is about doing things rapidly. 

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

Good Service Fast won't be cheap - You sacrifice cost for good/fast service

Fast service cheap won't be good - you sacrifice quality for speed
