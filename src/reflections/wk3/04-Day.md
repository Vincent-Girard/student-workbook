## What problems does the Observer pattern seek to solve? 

It's going to need a way to update parts of the page in response to specific events with the data that it provides. It allows mulitple data binding between elements!


 ## What are the three mechanissms of the observer pattern? 

The Subscribe Method - This is used to add new events 

The Unsubscribe Method - This is used to remove events.

The Broadcast Method - This is used to call all the events. This iteratates through the observed events and executes all callbacks
