# Tuesday 12-15 Encapsulation in Javascript
_Journal Entry_

## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and restricts it to inside the bundle. You are unable to pull that information out of the bundle. 
 

 ## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix? 

You make yourself more vulnerable to hackers by increasing the surface area for hackers to use it to exploit. The underscore prefix is generally considered pretty sloppy and removing the underscores alone can cause bugs in code. 

 

 ## How do we create private vairables in a ES6 class? Why would you do this?  

You are able to use private fields. You want to make stuff private that you do not intend people to mess with. If it's there, then someone is probably going to try to mess with it at some point
