# Monday 3-1-21


## I was able to get 98% of the server done over the weekend including the stretch goals. The only thing that was bothering me was hte VK tests that kept saying that the newly created one wasn't working.... when I could see it being made. I had to work through a lot of the populate stuff especially the part where we had to do multiple populates in a single query.
