# Thursday 12-10 REad intro to JS > The Mistakes i made as a beginner programmer

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code? 

It allows you to think out the functionality of the code that you are going to write. You don't want to overcomplicate it and overplan, but you need to have something that is considered good enough. It will help with your organization of the code, better functionality (hopefully), etc. If you don't have a rough idea of where you are going then it is going to be very easy to get lost and not remember the scope. 

## 2. How do you find answers when you are stuck? 

You should take a break from the code and try to come back to it feeling refreshed. Then you should start googling the problem, becausel ikely someone has run into it before. 

## 3. From the entire article what are you biggest takeaways? 

The biggest takeaway that I had from this is that you shouldn't be married to the first solution to a problem that you find. You you would be better set if you started to rethink the problem and try to find mulitple solutions. It also is basically saying stop trying to fit a square peg into a round hole just because you worked hard on the code. You shouldn't be married to the code taht you are writing and always should strive to be organized and adaptable
