# Wednesday 12-8 REad Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style? 

Elements tab - This tab should be used when you are trying to debug your code for HTML/CSS. These will not be saved into your file, so you can do whatever you want

Network Tab - If you are having trouble connecting to the site this will be a great place to look. You can see your requests/any errors etc

Console: This is where you would run your javascpript 

Application tab: Alows you to see your local storage and the cookies that you have saved to your computer 


## 2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? 

The elements function. This is a very valuable tool because you can write what you would into your CSS and see if it will yield the results that it gives to you. 

## 3. Outside of writing everything to the console what is a better way to debug your code? 

Read it to a rubber duck, usually while you are explaining the code to your duck you will realize the answer. You can also use debugger to figure out which portion of something is not working.
