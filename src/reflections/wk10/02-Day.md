# Tuesday 2-16-21 Foundations of C# > C# List


## 1. What is a list in C# and how does it compare to an Array? 

A list is a data structure that supports several operations. A list's memory is dynamic and random whereas an array's memory is static and continous. 

## 2. What list methods seem like you might use them often? Provide at least 2 examples and how they are written? 

List.Find - Based on the experience with javascript, we need to have the ability to find the information that we are looking for and bring it in to manipulate or use the data. 
        int item = list.Find(x => x > 2)

List.add - I think this is going to be one that we use a lot initially, especially when trying to construct lists. 

        list.Add(6)

## 3. What methods can be used to find an item from a list? How could you remove the item once it has been found? 
To Find: 

List.Contains

List.Find

List.Equals


To Remove: 

List.Remove

List.RemoveAt
